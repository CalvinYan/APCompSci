The MyCow project creates a simple window with a drawing of a cow in it. The cow is standing in a sunny field, and it is programmed to periodically blink.

This meets the assignment specifications, which require that we use the template files on Schoology and add aesthetic features like animations and a background.

The only significant issue with this project is that the blinking feature results in the program only being able to close after the cow blinks. This could be corrected
by creating a MouseEvent that detects when the exit button is clicked and terminates the timing loop.

The projects consists of two files: Main.java and CowFrame.java. The CowFrame draws the cow and background and controls animation, while Main creates a new CowFrame and displays it.

No major challenges were experienced in the making of this project.

The skeleton code for this project was taken from the http://paleyontology.com/oop/Cow/ url on Schoology. All other work is my own.
