The actual drawing of the flag uses three modules. One module creates the window, one module adds all
of the flag components, and one module specifically draws a star.

Probably the most challenging and meaningful part of this project was the star module, as the star
needs to be perfect and requires the use of trigonometry to be drawn. I am somewhat proud that I was
able to create the stars without outside help. The other components consist of simple rectangles and
a double for-loop for the 50-star pattern, and the entire project is finished.

Although I was able to complete the project without much difficulty, I am not sure how to preserve the flag's
aspect ratio after resizing the window and would like some guidance on this.
